# gnome-shell-of-mine
I need to make gnome a perfect one. Maybe only for me. 
Branch mine contains all you need. Switch to mine to download or check the code. Have fun!

Oh, note that this is based on ubuntu/jammy branch of gnome-shell. So should you happen to using jammy, it should be painless to install it.
